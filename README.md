A collection of personal weapons, armor, and more that I've made for my own use.  In no way shape or form balanced in fact most likely rather overtly OP.

Requires Tactical Gear Component by MoxoPixel ( https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1555-tactical-gear-component/ ) as I'm not an artist and really like the look of that mods items.

Code that handels item adding from the json files is from the Welcome to Tarkov series of mods as it does a great job handling item adding and lets me focus on the stats and tweaks that I'm making

All items should be for sale at Peacekeeper lvl 1 the prices are intended to be rather high in an attempt to balance them at least a little bit.

Highlights of the mod:
- Mk-18 Gungnir .338 Luapa Magnum DMR
  - A triplex .338 firing rifle.  I wanted to replicate the functionality of guns like the HK-G11 where 1 trigger pull fired a tight cluster of bullets.  Couldn't get a good result with recoil based spread and recoil based spread woul require a full auto fire rate that is insanely high.  Instead fires a .338 round that acts like a super tight spread shotgun shell.
  - Has no recoil.  This will likely change at some point as it's mostly a left over from my recoil based expirments
  - Has full auto and semi auto fire modes.  Full auto fires at 360rpm.  The low RPM is due to each shot firing 3 bullets.  So the effective fire rate is actual tripple the displayed amount.  Sadly another artifact of my efforts to get the single shot 3 bullet functionality.
  - Mainly picked due to it's large size and nice look for a beffy heavy gun.
- Gngr .338 LM 50-round magazine
  - A 50 round magazine for the Gungnir.  Technically can be used with the Mk-18 as well.
  - Forewarning a fully loaded mag weighs 3 kg so really heavy
- .338 Luapa Magnum Triplex AP
  - The star of the show.  A bullet that shoots 3 rounds.  Each of which match the performance of the .338 LM AP round.  Very much not balanced.  Can only be fired by the Gungnir.
- Mk-18 Gungnir .338 LM Triplex 24 inch barrel
  - The unsung hero that makes this all possible.  MAKE SURE TO EQUIP THE GUNGNIR WITH IT OR ELSE THE SPREAD OF TRIPLEX AMMO WILL BE MASSIVE
  - Again MANDATORY for the desired effect.  The 'ShotgunDispersion' property on a weapons barrel is the KEY to getting tight shotgun pellet spread.  Which is how the whole 3 shot 1 trigger pull is made to work in this mod.
- Foundery Armored Chest Rig
  - A heavily adjusted PARACLETE APC from Tactical Gear Component
  - The main feature is the fact that all of it's soft armor is sold seperately and can be readily replaced in case any of them get too damaged.  Note you can't use the armor unless all of the soft armor is installed
    - This is mostly a personal change.  As one of my biggest personal gripes about body armor is how one part or another gets heavily damaged more often than others.  To the point I usually end up wanting to replace body armor when just a shoulder or neck section get its max HP heavily reduced.  Having the soft armor be swappable avoids that issue.
  - The soft armor is on the higher side of HP each area being roughly in line with the FORT SMOG armor
  - Extra feature of the soft armor is the fact that front, back, neck, and shoulders are all class 4 armor.  As there are some softarmor that have class 4 protection in game but none that can mount plates.  And in the case of neck and shoulders those areas are normally impossible to protect by anything more than class 3 armor so adding class 4 is a notable personal improvement I've long wanted
  - Has a rig layout matching the Osprey Defense.  But once I get more comfortable modding that I'll likely adjust that as well.
- Foundery Full Plate
  - Another personal want, and admitedly quite OP, a level 6 UHMWP plate with 65 HP and low weight at 1.1kg.  Not much to say beyond that.  Mostly just wanted a high end easy to repair front and back plate
- Foundery Side Plate
  - Another personal want, and admitedly OP, a level 6 UHMWP plate with 25 HP and low weight at 0.75kg.  Not much to say beyond that.  Mostly just wanted a high end easy to repair side plate as all the base game side plates are ceramic and practically pointless to repair
- Foundery Comtek Backpack
  - Always loved how the Mystery Ranch Radio Backpack looked and was always sad that in the base game it weighs an insane amount AND can't carry much.  Therefore I was super happy to see that Tactical Gear Component adds an even better looking one.
  - Stat change wise it's rather small.  Making it match the inventory size and weight of the Tasmanian Tiger Trooper 35 which has the statline I most enjoy of the base game backpacks
- Foundery Armored Headcover
  - Another great model from Tactical Gear Component
  - Made it into something I've wanted for a long time in game.  Essentially a last line of defense armored head cover that also protects the neck.  Acting as a final line of defense against any rounds that sneak through any openings or weakspots in a helmet
  - Class 4 UHMWP single part armor with 55 HP that covers: Face, Nape, Head Top, Eyes, Jaw, Ear, Neck Front, Neck Back
